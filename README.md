### 5. MCP (Memory Cache + Persistent Storage) with Priority Workflow

**üíæ Intelligent Caching with Priority Logic:**
- **MCP First**: System always checks MCP before calling Gemini or fetching from other sources
- **Freshness Tracking**: Tracks timestamp metadata for all cached content
- **15-day Freshness Threshold**: Automatically refreshes stale data from original sources
- **Source Priority**: MCP ‚Üí ArXiv ‚Üí Gemini (in order of preference)
- **Reduces API Calls**: Prioritizes cached content while ensuring up-to-date information

**üîÑ Priority Workflow:**
1. **Check MCP First**: `mcp_store.query_mcp(query)` for relevant content
2. **If MCP has fresh content**: Use cached documents to generate answer
3. **If MCP is stale**: Automatically refresh from original source (ArXiv/docs)
4. **If MCP is empty**: Search ArXiv, save results to MCP for future use
5. **Fallback to Gemini**: Only if no relevant documents found anywhere

**üìä Cache Management:**
- View cache statistics in the sidebar
- Clear expired entries automatically
- Monitor cached documentation sources with age information
- Track cache age and document counts
- Manual refresh controls for specific topics

**üéØ Source Indicators:**
- **MCP Cache**: `üß† Source: MCP Cache [from NUMPY] (updated: July 1, 2025)`
- **MCP Refreshed**: `üîÑ Source: MCP (Freshly Updated) [from ARXIV] (updated: July 2, 2025)`
- **ArXiv Papers**: `üìö Source: ArXiv Papers [from ARXIV] (updated: July 2, 2025)`
- **Gemini Fallback**: `ü§ñ Source: Gemini AI [from GEMINI]`

**Example Priority Workflow:**
1. Ask: "What is SLAM in robotics?"
2. **Step 1**: System checks MCP for SLAM documentation
3. **Step 2**: If found and fresh: Uses MCP content, shows `üß† Source: MCP Cache`
4. **Step 3**: If found but stale: Refreshes from ArXiv, shows `üîÑ Source: MCP (Freshly Updated)`
5. **Step 4**: If not found: Searches ArXiv, saves to MCP, shows `üìö Source: ArXiv Papers`
6. **Step 5**: If no ArXiv: Uses Gemini, shows `ü§ñ Source: Gemini AI`

### 6. Using Document Features

**üìÑ PDF Upload:**
- Upload your own PDF documents (textbooks, papers, notes)
- Documents are automatically processed and indexed
- Content is included in future question answers
- View and manage uploaded files in the sidebar

**üî¨ ArXiv Integration:**
- Toggle "Use ArXiv Papers" to include recent research
- Search for specific topics: "PID control robotics"
